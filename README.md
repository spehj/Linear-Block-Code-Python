# Linear Block Code Exercise in Python
Linear Block Code algorithm implemented in Python.

First exercise (vaja5b.py):
Write a program that will determine and list all possible replacements M = {xi} the code specified by the given matrix for checking the jurisdiction. Then he should list all the multiple errors he is able to correct with the given matrix. The program should then accept as input any sequence of binary symbols of the same length as such code swaps. Then, with the help of the given matrix for checking the jurisdiction, it should detect and correct errors in the input sequence and print out the valid code swaps at the output.
```
python vaja5b.py
```
Second exercise (vaja5c.py):
Complete the program by creating an array to verify the authenticity of the Hamming code to eliminate all one-time errors. The input to the program in this case is only the number of control bits of code. The program should then perform all the remaining steps as given in the previous point.
```
python vaja5c.py
```
